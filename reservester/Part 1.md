<h3>Part 1: </h3>
<p>
	Kick-off sample with Rails</p>
<p>Generate a vanilla Rails project</p>
<p>Understand the basic structure of a Rails project</p>
<p>Test the Rails development server</p>

<h3>Reflect</h3>
<li>What is Rails?</li>
<li>What is meant by Rails being “opinionated”?</li>
<li>What are the advantages and limitations in generating the project over writing the pieces individually?</li>
<li>Why does Rails generate so much “stuff”?</li>

<h3>Part 2: Deploy to Heroku</h3>

<li> At the end of all of the labs, you should have a working product deployed to Heroku. To do this, you’ll need to modify your project to use Postgresql for production.
